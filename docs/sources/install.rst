Installation
------------

The fritzconnection package is available on `PyPi <https://pypi.org/>`_ and installable by `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_  ::

    $ pip install fritzconnection

This installation will also install the required packages `requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/>`_ and `lxml <https://lxml.de/>`_. If this does not work (for whatever reason) these packages can can also get installed by pip: ::

    $ pip install requests
    $ pip install lxml

It is not necessary but good practice to do the installation in a virtual environment â€“ either by means of `venv <https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/venv.html?highlight=venv#module-venv>`_ or `conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ (comes with `miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ or `anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_).

fritzconnection runs with Python 2.7 and 3.5+ (older versions are not tested). For new projects the most recent Python 3 version is recommended.
