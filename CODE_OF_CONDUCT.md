# Code of Conduct

## tldr:

There are a lot of CoC files out there and the essence is: be nice to others and keep in mind that written communication differs from in person communication.

So in comments please don't be negative but neutral, or –even better– all the time friendly. Because every other mode can get misunderstood (and everything misunderstandable will get misunderstood).

However, even then it may happen that one can feel upset in a discussion. In this case take a night of sleep before responding. Also asking questions can help a lot.

Regarding the code of this project, here are some guidelines:


## pull requests

In general pull requests are welcome. The smaller the better. Smaller pull requests are easier to review and easier to merge – especially in cases when not every part of a larger changeset should get merged.

In case of doubt please start a discussion first about the idea – before putting too much work into a pull request that may not get merged at the end, for whatever reason. A discussion can help to clarify points of view and motivation, not obvious at first by just providing a pull request.


## status of core and lib

fritzconnection is mainly the code in the core-directory. This code is pretty stable so far.

Most changes are in the library (the lib-directory). The library started mainly as a collection of examples how to use the core. Because it's easier to use an existing function instead of reading the AVM TR-064 documentation, the library modules have grown over time.

But every action supported by AVM can get executed without the library. So best enhancements are not too trivial tasks.
